The process of creating a linux desktop shortcut is a little more involved so I refer you to this https://askubuntu.com/questions/64222/how-can-i-create-launchers-on-my-desktop

I have already created the required Desktop Entry file and you just need to set it up such that it points to your "make it windows.sh" script file.
